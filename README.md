Play Relax Slot Machine Game

Link: https://relax-slot.web.app/

This project is a slot machine game made as an interview test task.

The main technologies are PixiJS and VanillaJS.

I tried to fulfill all the requirements in the task, but as always there is a lack of time. If I had more time I would definitely try to do the task with React and React-pixi-fiber and work on better code structure.
